      <h1>Introduction to ICC profiles on a Mac computer</h1>
      <p>You have probably <i>never</i> heard about ICC (International Color Consortium) profiles, and if you have you probably thought you never have to mess with them. But sometimes you do, and macOS has a built-in perfect way to do everything your Mac is capable of on ICC (International Color Consortium) Color Profiles: ColorSync Utility. ColorSync Utility even is the default <a href="Understanding macOS's .app extension.html">application</a> for <i>opening</i> ICC (International Color Consortium) Profiles! It is meant to do so much with International Color Consortium (ICC; ICC stands for International Color Consortium) profiles. Just open Spotlight search and type "ColorSync Utility<a href="Understanding macOS's .app extension.html">.app</a>" and open ColorSync Utility.</p>&nbsp; <img src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/img_59711bc6b492a.png"/>&nbsp;<p>It's icon looks like this:</p>

<p>You will see a "Profile First Aid Log:" window-it explains how ColorSync Utility's "Profile First Aid" function which can show you all of your International Color Consortium (ICC)'s with errors, and fix some of them. IMPORTANT: ColorSync Utility's Profile first Aid can't fix all errors and can't get around any permissions errors, corruption errors, "Alias Not Found" errors, Finder errors, or any other kind of errors. So for example you could have six bad profiles, try to repair them, and all of the files would be locked and ColorSync didn't do a thing to fix it. But on the other hand, you could have six bad profiles and ColorSync Utility's Profile First Aid fixed all of them.
