    <p>We searched high and low for that page, but we can't seem to find it anywhere! Yep, I'm sorry to say we had a 404 error. If you manually typed the URL in, check the spelling and case. If you clicked a link or button and got this message, <a href="mailto:elvescatcher@gmail.com?subject=Broken link or button">email me</a>! Currently we are aware of some "Go back home" buttons not working.
    And are you sure the page you're looking for is on THIS website (uniqueusernam.github.io)? If you meant to see a page on another site, look for you're page on that site.
    Also, one more tip: all kinds of errors can be resolved by refreashing the page. Try refreshing the page. And if we just created the page, it takes a few muinutes to save and publish our changes. Try waiting a few muinites and refreshing the page. And even if the page is not new, waiuting a few muinites and refreshing might just fix the error anyway. And I reccomend switching browsers and <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en">clearing recent cookies and cache</a>. And try starting back from our <a href="uniqueusernam.github.io">Home Page</a> to find what you're looking for!<br/>
If none of these fixes worked, try <a href="mailto:elvescatcher@gmail.com?subject=404-error">emailing me</a> or going back to our <a href="uniqueusernam.github.io">Home Page</a> if you haven't already tried that. And replace and slashes except the first slash with colons in the URL, weather you manually typed the adress in or followed a link or button.</p>
