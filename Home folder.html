Your home folder is named with your user name—it’s not actually named Home. In your home folder, there are folders for your desktop files, downloads, pictures, documents, movies, music, and for any public files.
The Home folder icon.

If your Mac has several users set up, each user has a home folder. When you’re logged in, the icon for your home folder looks like a house, and the other home folders look like regular folders. If you log out and someone else logs in, that person’s home folder looks like a house.
Your home folder is the folder for your data. When you open the Home folder, it has mos of your data, your public data, your private Applications, your Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folder, and more data for the logged-in user. If you open someone else's Home folder, most of their data will be locked to you.

<i>Note:</i> If you’re using iCloud Desktop and Documents, folders for your desktop files and documents are located in the iCloud section of the Finder sidebar, instead of your home folder.

To open your home folder, click the desktop to make sure you’re in the Finder, then choose Go > Home. Your Home folder can also be found in Macintosh HD>Users.
