<p>If you've ever had file corruption before, you know it's bad. File corruption can range from you not seeing the icon of some app to your entire hard drive and all the data on it getting broken and unusable in any way. In this guide I will help you diagnose file corruption and it's cause, and then multiple strategies for fixing it. Let's fix that file!</p>
<h1>Common symptoms of corrupted files, corrupted data, and corrupted filesystems.</h1>

<p>Before we can try to fix file corruption, we need to know for sure if you <i>have</i> fle corruption, and if so what kind. This can help to fix file corruption later. Here are some common symptoms of file corruption and common types of corruption:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Getting an error message when opening an app or file:</b> This is the most common symptom of file corruption. If when you try to open an app or file, then something is probably wrong and you probably have a corrupted file. Common messages are "You can't open the file (or application if it's an app) "filename or appname.extension" because it is damadged or incomplete.", ""Filename or appname.extension" is damadged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash.", "Corrupted file.", ""Appname or filename.extension" is damadged and can't be opened. You should move it to the bin.", or "Error. The installation cannot continue as the installer file may be damadged. Download the installer file again.(if you have trouble installing, <a href="How to use the Installer CORRECTLY.html">here is a guide on troubleshooting Installer errors</a>.)".</li>
  <li><b>Unable to edit the file:</b> If you open a file you own and created only to find you can't edit it, the data may be corrupted. Some data or file corruption stops you from editing files, even if you can open them.</li>
  <li><b>Some error message pops up when you try to preform an everyday nomal action on the file, and you haven't messed with the file:</b> If the data in that file/app or the file/app itself is corrupted, everyday actions might have errors as a result of file, data, or app corruption. </li>
  <li><b>Unexpected results when using the file/app/data:</b> Corrupted data might not respond correctly to you or the app. This ay be a sign you have data corruption.</li>
  <li><b>Scrambled or unreadable data:</b> Corrupted data might be scrambled or unreadable as a result of corruption. The data might be encoded.</li>
  <li><b>Your computer might produce clicking sounds, excessive vibration, and/or lots of heat and/or fan noise when working with the file/app/data:</b> If this is the case, the data may be hard to process due to corruption, or you have a corrupted hard drive.</li>
  <li><b>Files and folders are disappearing:</b> Your files and flders might just downright vanish from your hard drive if the corruption is serious enough. You have very extreme corruption if this is the case.</li>
  <li><b>File or folder names have changed or become cryptic or encoded:</b> Your data might be corrupted and not working properly, so the names have changed. Something might be wrong with the file if the name changes.</li>
  <li><b>S.M.A.R.T. monitoring shows issue with HDD:</b> Your disk may be corrupted and be having errors due to corruption. S.M.A.R.T. Status might be wrong.</li>
  <li><b>There may be other symptoms.</b></li>
  <h1>Fixing corruption</h1>
  <p>Once you have diagnosed that you have corruption and what kind, it's time to actually <i>fix</i> te corruption. Here's some things you can try:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Reset the permissions:</b> Selct the file and press Command-I to open up the Get Info window. Expand the "Sharing and permissions" pane (scroll down if you need to, if it is already expanded, continue), and click the lock (ðŸ”’) icon. Enter an administrator's name and password or administrator's Touch ID. Make sure that "Everyone" has "Read & Write" permission and if not select it from the privlages drodown next to Everyone. Now select the gear (âš™) icon and select "Apply to enclosed items". If there are items owned by another user in this folder, please don't do this. If you have items or documents you locked in this folder and want to keep them locked, don't do this either. <b><i>IF YOU HAVE A CORRUPT APP OR FILE INSTEAD OF A FOLDER, DO THIS TO THE FOLDER THE CORRUPTED FILE OR APP IS INSIDE.</i></b> Select "Ok" when the Finder warns you. Wait for Finder to load.
Once Finder finishes loading, see if the file is still corrrupted.</li>
<li><b>Copy the file, delete the original, and rename the copy to something that is not the original name:</b> If the file, app, folder, or data is corupted, it might be wise just to copy (do not make an alias, it won't work)
