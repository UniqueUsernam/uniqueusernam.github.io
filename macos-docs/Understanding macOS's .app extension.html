    &nbsp; &nbsp;<h1>Intro</h1>
    <p>Most people use computers for their jobs, making electronic douments, personal or work e-mails, social media, and the Internet. All of these services are provided through programs, or Applications (you can use PowerPoint and adobe Acrobat for your job, you can use Word, Notes, or WordPad to make electronic documents-to learn more about electronic documents, go to How do word processors work-you can use the gmail app, Apple Mail and more for personal or work e-mails, you can use the Facebook app, Instagram app, the WhatsApp app, a <a href="Understanding web browsers.html">Web Bowser</a>, or other social media app, and you can acess the internet with the Google Search app or a <a href="Understanding web browsers.html">Web browser</a>). But how does your computer know what file is an app (so it opens with itself-any file that is <b>not</b> an application opens with another application, but applications open with themselves and not other applications, because your computer knows it's an application and should open with itself and not another program)? Because applications, just like all other files, have extensions-or more specifically, the <i>.app</i> extension. </p>

<h1>How your computer responds to the .app extension</h1>
<p>So we know the .app extension tells the computer "Hey computer! Don't open me with another application-open me with myself!" and the computer responds like this: "Ok, application! When this user opens this file I will open it with itself!". But what if your computer misresponds to the extension? This can only happen if you are on a PC viewing Mac-only files, if the extension is misspelled, or if you have a corrupted or unavaliable Finder. Like if you accidentally say ".gpp" or ".dapp" or ".ap" or another misspelling of ".app," or if you try to transfer an application from a Mac to a PC and keep the ".app" at the end. PC's might not understand ".app" because they might use a different extension for applications. Or your Finder or computer is not able to understand the ".app" extension because of corruption or unavalibility. In all three of those cases, your computer (PC or Macintosh) might misenterpret the ".app" extension and open one program with another program. Or, your misenterpreting or corrupted computer could say "There is no application set to open the file [MISENTERPRETED APPLICATION NAME HERE]. You can search the App Store for an application that can open "[MISENTERPRETED APPLICATION NAME HERE]" or choose an existing application on your computer." and you would get no results in the App Store and no reccomended ones on your computer. To avoid this, spell all extensions correctly, keep Mac-only files on Macs only, and don't mess with core system files or files that support the Finder, such as it's <a href="Understanding and using Application Support.html">Application Support folder</a>, named "Apple" in /Library/Application Support/Apple, and <b><i>DEFFINETLEY NEVER EVER TOUCH /Library/Apple BECAUSE THIS FOLDER HOLDS CORE FILES!</i></b>.</p>
<h1>Down to ones and zeros</h1>
<p>So the .app extension tells the computer it's an application. But the Finder dosen't read the .app extension like we do-to the Finder, ".app" is a string of ones and zeros. Each and every thing on a computer is transformed into binary code before it goes to the computer's CPU (Centeral Processing Unit), which controls everything-from filename extensions, files, apps, and the Finder, to third-party tools with full disk acess and the command line-because the CPU (Centeral Processing Unit) and the actuall machine is only understand binary language, or ones and zer0s
