      <h1>Opening incompatible applications on Mac or even iPad/iPhone</h1>
      <p>So you decide your system needs a software update, and next thing you know it, you can't open your favorite app. When you try, you see an error message like this:</p>
      <img src="https://www.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3675674/macos-catalina-32-bit-app-alert.jpg"/>
      <p>So here's what you can do before you resort to downgrading your operating system and causing <a href="commonComputerProblemFixes.html">even more problems</a> with that computer of yours. Here's some information for troubleshooting compatability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Install any avaliable updates-even small or optional ones</b>: First and foremost, <b>the best way to fix incompatability</b> is to update the app. Even if there is a tiny, you-don't-need-it, useless, optional update avaliabe in the app or on the app store or on the app's website, <b><i><u>DOWNLOAD IT</u></i></b>. Check the developer's website, the App Store, and choose <b>App-name</b> > Check for updates... or Restart and Install Update, or Update from the menu bar (different apps have Check for Updates... rather than Restart and Install Update, vice versa, etc.-so just choose the update option you have). And if your app has an Autoupdate or Update app (such as Microsoft Autoupdate), check that too. If any updates are avaliable anywhere, download and install any and all updates. The reason this is a good idea is because many app developers want their apps compatible with MacOS and update their apps to a compatible version.</li>
<li><b>Use Setapp</b>: Setapp is an app suite of (hopefully) compatible versions of tons of different applications with a free version and prices as low as 9.99$ (+ taxes, depending on your country). You can dwnload Setapp with <a href="https://setapp.com/">this link</a>. You can use Setapp to get (hopefully) compatible versions of your software.</li>
<li><b>You might be able to make do with an alternative</b>: This one is self-explanatory: search for the best alternative software and give them a whirl.</li>
</ul>
<p>If no updates are avaliable, the app isn't on Setapp or the Setapp version is incompatible, and there are no alternatives to the softwarwe (or they're all really bad) and there are no app of this works, you can submit feedback about the app asking for an update (and include your current MacOS version) and wait for a response, or you can even <a href="https://getsupport.apple.com/">contact Apple Support</a> or <a href="https://www.apple.com/feedback/">submit Apple product feedback</a> saying you want your app to be supported. Include your current MacOS version number and name (like MacOS Catalina 10.15.7), the current version name/number of your app, the name of your app, and if you're fine with it, include your email adress. I hope this helped!</p>
