<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>We all use web browsers to explore the internet. Weather you use Mozzila Firefox, the Google Search app, Internet Explorer, Opera, Google Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, or another browser, here's what you need to know.</p>

<h1>Internet traffic</h1>
<p>When you browse the internet, there is actually a lot going on in your browser and in multiple web servers to get you to the right page when you type a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and even more when you type a Google search. First of all, when you type a URL, your computer searches it's own cached memory for an IP adress for that URL because computers and web browsers can only understand numbers; there is a number for every URL, or an "IP (Internet Protocal)" adress. And if you need to be auto-logged in or use <a href="What is SSO and SSL.html">SSO</a> (Single Sign On), even <i>more</i> URLs are added to the process because the <a href="What is SSO and SSL.html">SSO</a> has URLs it uses to complete the <a href="What is SSO and SSL.html">SSO</a> process.
