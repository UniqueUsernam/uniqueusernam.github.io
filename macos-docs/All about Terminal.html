  <p>Terminal is basically the only way you could use a computer back in the day. Now there is Graphical User Interface (GUI; GUI is basically the files being displayed, applications launching, the Finder, how the computer displays things, and how you interact with the computer) and people use computers totally differently now. But Terminal can still be useful, and has features not usable in GUI. You can, for example, actually <i>force things to open</i> in Terminal. You can even have files & folders open in Terminal, it has a variety of usable text editors and can run & display code. You can also view and edit the contents of a file with the <span class="Terminal-command">cat</span> command, but we will learn about that later. To make a file open with Terminal, just control-cick it, choose Open With and then Other..., now double-click Utilities, change the dropdown at the bottom to "All applications" and deselect Always open with (this can cause problems), wait a few seconds, select Terminal.app, and click Open at the bottom of the window. Now watch Terminal open your file. If it shows nothing or shows an error, thst file is not executable. If it does work, though, the file will open with Terminal-and run!</p>

  <p>"exec" means "Executable", which basically means it opens and runs with Terminal or one of it's text editors. Be careful with exec files though; if you open an unknown exec file it might run a malicious process, or just run some process you don't know about, and that can result in viruses, data loss, or your computer not working properly. And you can't always find out if an exec file really <i>is</i> an exec file because any file with no proper extension automatically <i>looks</i> like an exec file-but that dosen't mean it is. This means that a hacker could create a malicious <i>application</i>, remove it's ".app" extension (to find out more about the ".app" extension, go to <a href="Understanding macOS's .app extension.html">Understanding macOS's .app extension</a>), and the malicious <a href="Understanding macOS's .app extension.html"><i>application</i></a> would appear as an exec file but still run and open as an <a href="Understanding macOS's .app extension.html">application</a> because <a href="Understanding macOS's .app extension.html">applications</a> are technically executable. And unknown exec files might trigger or run other unknown things dowm the line until your computer is not working as it should be. Exec files do not have a ".exe" ".exec" or ".executable" extension. You can find hundreds of exec files in /usr/sbin (usr stands for <b>U</b>nix <b>S</b>ystem <b>R</b>esources, or just <b>Us</b>e<b>r</b>) or in /usr/bin.</p>
<h1>A basic understanding of Terminal</h1>
<p>Before we can begin explaining the different Terminal commands, let's get you up to speed on the basics of Terminal. Each command in Terminal has three parts: the main command (a main command is like "open" in the command open /private/var/folders-it is the command beforere what the command is supposed to modify or affect, or any customizations, attributes, or extensions you use for the command), any attributes or customizations to the command (this is not an essential part, any command will work fine without this part in fact; but if you want to make the command do something it dosen't normally do (for example, to copy a folder <i>and</i> it's contents with the cp command, to do that you would have to add -R to tell the Terminal you want to do that), you'll have to use attributes)
  <h1>Sudo, crutisl disable, and sudo open</h1>
  <p><span class="Terminal-command">Sudo</span>, <span class="Terminal-command">crutisl disable</span>, and <span class="Terminal-command">sudo open</span> are what I like to call "Force Commands" because they force actions to happen. For example, you could get past protected or locked folders. Let's talk about these commands. First of all, "sudo" is <i>the</i> force command: if you add "sudo" to the biginning of any Terminal main command (a main command is like <span class="Terminal-command">open</span> in the command open /private/var/agentx-it is the command beforere what the command is supposed to modify or affect) it becomes a force command (such as you could get past the protections on a locked folder such as "agentx" by adding sudo before main command. Example: sudo open /private/var/agentx would open the locked folder agentx even though open /private/var/agentx would not because "agentx" is locked). But just typing <span class="Terminal-command">sudo</span> and then a file path with no other commands would just get you a syntax error. Terminal would say "sudo: [FIlE PATH YOU TYPED]: command not found." <span class="Terminal-command">sudo</span> stands for <b>Su</b>peruser <b>Do</b> and operates by taking any command with <span class="Terminal-command">sudo</span> before the main command (or after the main command, a semicolon, and a space-example: open; sudo or open; sudo rm) and telling the computer to interpret that command as a command coming from the superuser of the computer, a user that has permission to acess anything except <a href="What is SIP.html">SIP (System Integrity Protection)-protected files</a>.
    Second, there is <span class="Terminal-command">crutisl disable</span>. <span class="Terminal-command">crutisl disable</span> is a command that disables <a href="What is SIP.html">SIP (System Integrity Protection)</a>, giving you acess to even the most core and protected system files and folders. But if you want to run this command, you must boot from a different startup volume so modifying core permissions on your normal startup disk dosen't wreck your computer. If you want to run <span class="Terminal-command">crutisl disable</span>, reboot, and immediatley press and hold the command key and the r key. Once your computer boots and you see a <b>macOS Utilities</b> window
