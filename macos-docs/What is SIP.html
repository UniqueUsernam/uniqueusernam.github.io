<p>SIP (System Integrity Protection) is a security feature in certain versions of macOS that protects the most core and important files your Mac needs to operate. It stands for <b>S</b>ystem <b>I</b>ntegrity <b>P</b>rotection. Not all system files are protected by SIP (System Integrity Protection), just the really really really important ones. For example, your entire VM (Virtual Memory) disk has the full protection of the SIP (System Integrity Protection) because deleting Swapfiles or all-important Kernelcore file could tottaly wreck your system. What the SIP does is that you can't move, delete, duplicate, edit, or edit permissions on a file protected by SIP (System integrity Protection), not even when using the <a href="All about Terminal.html">sudo, sudo rm, open; sudo rm, or cd; sudo rm</a> commands, which normally would force any file to be deleted, edited, changed permissions, or moved, no matter how protected the file was. But SIP (System Integrity Protection) can block even that because SIP (System Integrity Protection) basically controls what you can and can't do with core system files. It is only applied to your startup disk, so SIP (System Integrity Protection) does not work in <a href="What is Recovery OS mode.html">Recovery OS mode</a> because Recovery OS Mode uses a different startup volume.</p>
<h1>What SIP does</h1>
<p>SIP does just what it sounds like: it protects the System's integrity. If you try to mess with core System directories, SIP will block you from deleting, modfying, moving, copying, and sometimes even <i>opening</i> them. But are all System files and folders protected by SIP? <i>No</i>. Only the most core of all that your computer would simply be tottally destroyed without. In fact, only /System (see <a href="Top-level folders.html">top-level folders in Mac OS X</a>), /private/var, apps that are pre-installed with Mac OS X, and all of the contents of /usr except /usr/local. /usr stands for <b>U</b>nix <b>S</b>ystem <b>R</b>esources, but some people might just call it <b>us</b><span class='notbold' style="color:black">e</span><b>r</b>. Even logged in as root user, you can't get past SIP (wewl I guess I've done it, and I wasn't even logged in as root user, but that's a different story. You can see how I hacked SIP <a href="I%20have%20no%20right%20to%20access%20:usr:sbin:authserver.html">here</a>).</p>
