  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>You might or might not have heard of Apple's "Recovery Operating System Mode" or just "Recovery Mode" built right into macOS. But Recovery Mode (or Recovery Operating System Mode) is basically a mode in macOS that holds all kinds of tools you might need to recover your Mac if it is not working properly. These include Restore from time Machine backup, Reinstall MacOS, Get help onine, and Disk Utility. Recovery mode can be very bad for your mac too, though; there is absolutely <i>no kind of security or password protection of ny king whatsoever</i> on Recovery mode (unless you set a firmware password through Recovery Mode's Startup Security Utility app, but by default that is off)-and that means a hacker can boot into Recovery OS Mode (to boot into Recovery Mode, just restart and immediatley press and hold these two keys: command<img src="https://www.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3462401/what_is_the_apple_key_on_mac_517.jpg" width="23px" hight="23px"/> and r) and then could erase your entire startup disk, resistall macOS on your whole computer, restore an extremely old backup of your computer, and possibly get into your Apple ID using the "Get More Help Online" option. And there is no way I know of to block all of this except setting a firmware password. So be careful, but if you want to learn more read on. First I will break down the features of Recovery Mode, and then the dangers, and then a conclusion.</p>
  <h1>Restore From Time Machine Backup</h1>

  <p>The first option of recovery mode is "Restore From Time Machine Backup" and you probably know what this means: restore your entire computer from a backup of all your data on Apple's Time Machine <a href="Understanding macOS's .app extension.html">application</a>. And the reason this is the first Recovery Operating System Mode option is becuse it is able to restore your entire computer to a previous state.</p>

  <p>This feature can take advantage of you Time Machine backups and your backup disk and restore all the data on your computer to a Time Machine backed up state.</p>

  <p>Sometimes this Recovery Mode feature can have errors and/or fail completely, and this can happen when backups are incompatible, your entire backup disk, backup, or only specific files are corrupted, your computer couldn't find your backup or backup disk, you selected a backup that was somehow on the list but was never actually completed, or another reason. This Recovery option links to an application called "Time Machine System Restore" which is the application that completes the restore. If you decide to use this feature, follow the onscreen instructions in Time Machine System Restore.</p>

  <h8>Here's how to restore your computer from a Time Machine backup:</h8>
  <span style="font-size:14px"><i>Some of this information is from imore.com. Not all of this information is from more.com, and some of the information was based on imore.com information but not the same, but some information in this how-to is from imore.com completely. The note below was from imore.com, but edits were made.</span>
<p><b>Note:</b> When you reboot and enter Recovery Mode, you won't see these instructions on this webpage because one: you rebooted (which loggs all users out and quits everything), and two: because macOS Recovery Mode isn't meant for viewing webpages. Because of this, I suggest printing out these instructions or switching to another device to read them.
  <ol>
    <li>Restart your computer and immediatly press these two keys: command(âŒ˜) and r to boot into recovery mode.</li>
    <li>When you see the "macOS Utilities" window, select the "Restore from Time Machine Backup" and press Continue.</li>
    <li>Click continue on the Restore Your System page.</li>
    <li>Select a backup you want to restore.</li>
    <li>Click Continue</li>
    <li>Select the Time Machine backup you want to restore. You can choose whatever version you like, but unless your Mac crashed and the crashed version was backed up as the most recent backup (which is actually more common then you think), we recommend choosing your most recent backup to avoid data loss.</li>
    <li>Click continue and wait.</li>
<li>Enjoy a restored Mac!</li>
</ol>
