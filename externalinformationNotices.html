      <h1>External Information Notices</h1>
      <p>On certain pages, you may see something like this:
        "NOTICE: Information from apple.stackexchange.com is used in this page. Some of it is the exact words of the consulted forum on apple.stackexchange.com, while other content on this page is edited and changed but still based on knowledge from apple.stackexchange.com. Some content on this page is original and created here without consulting apple.stackexchange.com. No liability is claimed.""
        in small, grey, italic text (like this: <span class="External-information-notice">NOTICE: Information from apple.stackexchange.com is used in this page. Some of it is the exact words of the consulted forum on apple.stackexchange.com, while other content on this page is edited and changed but still based on knowledge from apple.stackexchange.com. Some content on this page is original and created here without consulting apple.stackexchange.com. No liability is claimed.</span>). They are our "External Information Notices". We create External Information Notices when we copy exact text from other sources (like if example.com had the text "When iPad's open incompatible apps, you will get an error" and we put that exact text on our website), or put their exact ideas in our own words (like if example.com had the text "When iPad's open incompatible apps, you will get an error", and we put the text "When you open an incompatible app on an iPad, you will get an error"-not the exact text, but the exact idea in our own words). External Information Notices serve two purposes:
        <ul>
          <li>To notify you that certain page content is not original and that we did not provide it directly to you, but another website provided it and we used their words and ideas, and</li>
          <li>Because of copyright law and/or legal or through a policy protections on the usage of other website's ideas.</li>
        </ul>
</p>
<h1>Why are they small, grey, and italic?</h1>
<p>First and foremost, we are not trying to hide from you that we used other website's words and ideas on our pages. You should know, and we respect that. The reason our External Information Notices are small, grey, and italic, is becaue (wheather you like it or not), most people don't want to spend time reading legal notices or liability disclaimers. By making them small, grey, and italic, there isn't a big show-off legal notice interrupting people's reading of our pages. And bear in mind, anyone can feel free to read our External Information Notices if they <i>want</i> to. This might not sound that realistic for you, but we didn't make them <i>that</i> hard to read, and there isn't any link to view it-just right there on the page. We are being tottally honest here.</p>
