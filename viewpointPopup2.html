        <h2>What is a Kernel Panic?</h2>
<p>A Kernel Panic is one of the scariest things that can happen to a Mac user-a jet-black screen with a huge power symbol and the words "Your computer restarted because of a problem. Press a key or wait a few seconds to continue starting up." in a bunch of differet languages. And, it's indeed a very bad error. Kernel Panics are often described as fatal system errors, and the error is so severe the computer simply can't run. But DON'T WORRY! The scary Kernel Panic will go away as soon as you reboot (or press a key or wait a few seconds, if that's what it tells you to do). MacOS Kernal Panics are most commonly caused by a hardware problem or when the system does an "exception". An exception means that the system is doing something that is possibly unsafe and could result in bad errors (if it happened durring a MacOS update, maybe even <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210901">the worst error I know on a Mac, the Prohibitory Symbol</a>) or the loss of important data, and the system is trying to override the technology that blocks that from happening (which originally is there to protect the system). A Kernel Panic can be one of the measres taken to prevent the system from overriding that protection. But before you act like the Kernel and panic, read this.</p>
<h2>The cause of Kernel Panics</h2>
<p>Kernal Panics, as I said above, can be caused by hardware faults or the system trying to override protection and do something possibly dangerous. Quote: "MacOS Kernal Panics are most commonly caused by a hardware problem or when the system does an "exception". An exception means that the system is doing something that is possibly unsafe and could result in bad errors (if it happened durring a MacOS update, maybe even <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210901">the worst error I know on a Mac, the Prohibitory Symbol</a>) or the loss of important data, and the system is trying to override the technology that blocks that from happening (which originally is there to protect the system). A Kernel Panic can be one of the measres taken to prevent the system from overriding that protection." An exception could cause a Kernel Panic because the system is trying to protect itself, and a hardware fault could cause the system to not be able to run, and that's what a Kernel Panic is: something that is severe enough to stop the system from running. Kernel Panics may appear when updating MacOS, because to do something as complex as update MacOS, MacOS needs to use an exception to access protected rescources, and as i explained, that can cause Kernel Panics.</p>
<h2>Fixing Kernel Panics</h2>
<p>You can try the following to fix Kernel Panics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Force-restart (DO NOT TRY THIS DURING A MACOS UPDATE OER YOU WILL GET WORSE ERRORS THAN KERNEL PANICS!)</b>: DO NOT TRY THIS DURING A MACOS UPDATE OR YOU WILL GET WORSE ERRORS THAN KERNEL PANICS!) Restarting can (at least temporarily) get rid of Kernel Panics. Scince you are stuck in a jet-black screen with a huge power symbol and the words "Your computer restarted because of a problem. Press a key or wait a few seconds to continue starting up." in a bunch of differet languages, you might need to press and hold the power button (or Touch ID sensor, if that's what you have) until your computer turns off. I've said it before, and I will say it again, DO NOT try this during a MacOS update. Now wait five minutes and then press the power button/Touch ID again. Hopefully your Mac will boot up normally.</li>
  <li><b>Reset SMC, PRAM, and NVRAM (DO NOT TRY THIS DURING A MACOS UPDATE OER YOU WILL GET WORSE ERRORS THAN KERNEL PANICS!)</b>: DO NOT TRY THIS DURING A MACOS UPDATE OR YOU WILL GET WORSE ERRORS THAN KERNEL PANICS!)</b>: NVRAM
