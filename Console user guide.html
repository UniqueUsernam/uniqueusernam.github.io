<h1>What is Console?</h1>
<p>Console.app is an application built into macOS mainly used for troubleshooting problems. It displays log messages about what is going on in your mac. It displays details about problems with your computer. Console sorts these log messages into the following categories:
  <ul>
    <li>Faults (Red): Faults are the most severe and worst log messages you can see in Console. They are log messages in Console that identify extremely severe and possibly fatal errors for your mac. These messages have a red dot on the left side, next to the message name.</li>
    <li>Errors (yellow): These log messages are not as bad and not as severe as Faults. However, they are Console log messages that identify errors in your mac and can mean something is wrong. Your mac generates a lot of these, and you should not worry about them too much-but if you are having trouble with specific apps or specific actions, and there is an error log message in Console related to your problem, something is wrong.</li>
    <li>Debug log messages (dark grey): You generally don't have to worry about these. Technically they still mean something has some kind of bug, but they are the second lowest level of log message in Console. They exist because they log specific bugs in critical and known locations, but these usually are nothing. But if you have a buggy document or file in a critical or known location that isn't causing any real problems but not working as expected, debug log messages can help identify the non-error bug.</li>
    <li>Info log messages (light grey): These are ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING to worry about. They aren't even there to identify any kind of problem. They, as the name sugessts, only exist to give you information on the operations of the system. They just tell you the normal operation of the system and don't mean anything. They just log things in the system you don't need to worry about, and don't identify problems.</li>
  </ul></p><br/>
  <p><i>IMPORTANT: If you see no indicator color on the left side of the message next to the title, the log message is the default type. Usually it is a Debug or Info log message, and never a Fault or an Error.</i>
<h1>Device log messages in Consle</h1>
<p>The first thing you see in Console is the "Devices" list. It shows all your connected devices (for example, a paired Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Windows, Android, or PC) and all of the log messages for each device. Console always shows your current device (the device you are on right now) and any paired/connected device (like a paired Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Windows, Android, or PC). When you click a device in the list you will see all of the Console log messages for that device. You might have to enter a password (more on that in the Authentication section) to view a device's log messages for security reasons.
Once you select a device in the list, you will see all it's log messages.</p>
<h1>Reports in Console</h1>
<img src="https://help.apple.com/assets/5D92AAD30946229322010517/5D92AAE4094622932201051E/en_US/57bb1befaa8a980e27606e2fc6a20c5d.png">
<h3 style="color:white">Crash Reports</h1>
  <p>In the Console sidebar, under the "Reports" category, the first report will be Crash Reports. These reports log information about apps that recently crashed, including a list of recently crashed apps, the Activity ID and PID of the crashed app, the path of the crashed app, the Code Type and Version of the crashed app, the Date and Time the app crashed, the Anonyoums UUID, the Exception type, the User Id of the app, the exact thread of the app that crashed, an much more. Scince Console is ultimatley an app for troubleshooting problems, it logs as much as it can about the crashed program, how it happened, related ID's and more to help you identify and fix the app crashes it logs.</p>
  <h3 style="color:white">Spin reports</h2>
  <p>And spin reports. These are critical in troubleshooting problems because they repersent issues with apps. These errors aren't fatal and not as bad as crashes, but if you have a faulty app chances are there will be at least one spin report in Console. These reports identify and log as much information as possible on faulty apps and apps with errors. In Activity Monitor you can also "Spindump" an app. Spindump is a tool used to create hang report files to notify you of application hangs. For example, when the application crashes, Spindump will display a dialog box to alert you of the crash (onscreen, not in Console first) and allow you to 1.) View more details about the crash and/or 2.) Send the crash details to Vidyo or Apple.</p>
  <h3 style="color:white">Log reports</h2>
  <p>Log reports in Console are reports that log information on different activities. You can click on a log report to see long and detailed logged information on the interaction, process, background service, system activity, or whatever other thing that log is about in the Console window. Double-click it to open the entire log in a new window. Click on the NowüéØ button to enable/disable now mode on the current log report. When NowüéØ is blue, you will see a frozen version of the log not updating itself to see what is happening right now, and when it is grey the log will continuously update and log new information related to it's topic. Click the ReloadüîÑ button to reload the log and update it even in NowüéØ mode. Click Clear‚úèÔ∏è to clear the current log. Click Share‚¶Ω to share the log you are viewing. Activitiesüîó and Info‚ÑπÔ∏è are greyed out because they only work on log messages and not log reports or entire logs. These reports are useful to get logged information on a specific thing.</p>
  <h3 style="color:white">Diagnostic reports</h2>
  <p>Diagnostic reports are Console reports that log profiles and specific categories of information  <a href="Sample Console profile.html">click here to view an example profile</a>). The profiles are generally very long, logging specific information into a Console log profile of it's topic with the ".diag" extension. These report's main pourpase are to provide diagnostic log profiles on the activities of your mac. These logs are read by Console from /private/var/log/DiagnosticMessages.</p>
  <h3 style="color:white">Mac Analytics Data</h2>
  <p>Mac Analytics Data is basically logged profiles holding inforation about different intrractions with your mac. These profiles are a lot shorter then Diagnostic Report profiles-like maybe ten lines or so, versus, like seventy-nine. Another difference is that they log less data. They log a short list of identifiers rather then a seventy-nine or more full-blown log holding PIDs, Identifiers, Wakeups, wakeups per second, and every other kind of inforation you could think of. They also don't log information about everything from a process to a reboot; they only log Analytics Data for your mac, hence the name. A lot of items in the short list srtart with "com.". These profiles are useful when you want to see what goes on in your system for a specific intraction, maybe one that failed.</p>
  <h3 style="color:white">system.log</h3>
<p>system.log is a very special Console report. It is actually a specific log message displayed in the sidebar rather than a type of report or log message. When you click it, you are viewing the contents of a specific log file. When you double-click it in the sidebar, it opens in it's own window. When you open system.log, Console is actually reading from a file in /private/var/log/system.log-it is a seperate file. system.log loggs the services and running things on your Mac, and just stuff about the operation of the system. It constantly updates itself, even in Now mode. Sometimes you may see a "pushing respwan out by [number] seconds". <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1156916/lots-of-mac-sierra-service-only-ran-for-0-seconds-log-errors">More on superuser.com forums about pushing respwan out for [number] seconds.</a> system.log can be very active, even when you aren't really doing anything-because even though <i>you</i> might be quitting apps and doing nothing on your computer, the system is managing and launching Daemons and Agents (system processes-in a nutshell, Daemons are system processes run by and on the behalf of the System, and Agents are system/app processes run on behalf of the currently logged in user and can be run by apps or the System. Agents can be third party services (such as a Google Agent), while Daemons usually aren't third party and controlled by the System (such as a system Daemon that manages the filesystem in the background).)
