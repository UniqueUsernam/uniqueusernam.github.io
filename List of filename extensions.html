<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.db</b></button>
<div class="content">
<p>These files are database files, usually for the system. These files are "databases" of data that usually contain text. You can open them with TextEdit, or Xcode, but Finder will say there is not application set to open these.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.docx</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p><b>.docx</b>--A Microsoft Word document that is made in Mac OS X. It can contain text, images, grids, links, and special effects or videos.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.term</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>.term files are files that open and run with and in Terminal. If you want to save a Terminal process or command, you can put that command into a .term file after creating a file with the .term extension, and when you open that .term file, the command will run in Terminal.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.db-wal</b></button>
<div class="content">
  <p>.db-wal files are a special type of .db (database) files. They generally contain  lot of text, like a .log file (we can talk about .log fles later). You should open them with TextEdit. They have columns of text <br/>l<br/>
    i<br/>
    k<br/>
    e<br/> <br/>t<br/>h<br/>i<br/>s<br/>, and big blocks of text containing words, information, data, and paths.</p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.db-corrupt-wal</b></button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>.db-corrupt-wal files are just like .db-wal files: They generally contain  lot of text, like a .log file, you should open them with TextEdit, they have columns of text like this, and big blocks of text containing words, information, data, and paths. But these files are generally shorter, and they are <i>corrupted</i>. They also have more column text then block text.</p>
</div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.db-corrupt</b></button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>These files are corrupt databases. They are like a normal .db (database) file, but they are corrupted and their data is in a single file that is corupted. They may have null components. You can open them with TextEdit or Xcode or Microsoft Word. These files are usually just words. They may contain data (maybe corrupted data). To fix corrupted files, see <a href="How to get rid of file corruption.html">How to get rid of file corruption</a>.</p>
    </div>
      <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.keychain</b></button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>A certificate, password, login, encryption, or network that opens in Keychain. Usually created with Keychain, too.</p>
      </div>
          <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.database (NOT .db)</b></button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Don't get these files mixed up with .db files-these files don't have an abbreviation for .database how .db does, these files actually say the full word ".database" for their extensions. These files are HP Fax Archives. Their formatting is unreadable by the HP Fax Archive application, even though HP Fax Arcvive is what these files open with by default. When you open a .database file, HP Fax Arcvive will just say that HP Fax Archive can't open fles in the HP Fax Acvive format. .database files usually log recent information or recent times or recent action logs if they are system auto-generated. To open one, control-click the .database file, choose Open With>Other..., and scroll down until you find TextEdit. Then choose Open. DO NOT select the Always open with checkbox, this can cause problems. If you delete a .database file, it may come back because either permissions are wrong, it is logging recent information so it logs more info as you complete actions and is re-created, or the file it protected by the system. This might not always be true.</p>
          </div>
          <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.help</b></button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>.help files are saved help articles. If you didn't know before, Mac OS X has two mnuals: the Terminal manual (tells you about different commands and what they do), and the MacOS manual. .help files are saved articles in the MacOS manual. They open with HelpViewer.app (located in /CoreServices/HelpViewer.app), but if you just double-click the .help file it will automatically open with HelpViewer. Not all articles have to be saved to your Mac.</p>
          </div>
          <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.musiclibrary</b></button>
          <div class="content">
            <p>.musiclibrary files are actually NOT files. When you open them, they open with Music (not iTunes, <i>Music<a href="Understanding macOS's .app extension.html">.app</a></i>), and they show your library of songs and music. As the extension ".musiclibrary" suggests, that file is your library of music and songs. On a brand-new user, there is only one .musiclibrary file, and it is found in the sidebar item "ðŸŽ¶ Music" in the folder "Music". It's name is Music Library.musiclibrary.</p>
          </div>
          <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.keychain~orig</b></button>
          <div class="content">
          <p>These files are Keychain data files (a certificate, password, login, encryption, or network that opens in Keychain. Usually created with Keychain, too), but are original and unchanged. If you migrated data from another computer, maybe that file is a migrated Keychain file that stayed the same and did not change. Maybe a certificate that was changed by it's owner but is a backup and stayed the same.</p>
          </div>
          <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.plist</b></button>
          <div class="content">
          <p>All of these have the ".plist" extension which stands for "<b>P</b>roperty <b>List</b>" and opens with Xcode (a developer app pre-installed and developed by Apple). A .plist file is a system settings and preference file. Usually when you open them they look like a stack of bars with a â–¸ next to them to show more bars, and that holds more bars, so on. Each stacked bar has a name (or a "Key" as Xcode calls it), the type of data the bar is, a plus button and minus button (only visible when you hover over the specific stacked bar), an expand (â–¸) button to view the bars that bar contains, and in grey text between parenthases, how many other bars (or Items) that stacked bar contains. When you quick-look the .plist file, though, it shows a bunch of code (very usually XML code) instead of stacked data bars, which only become visible when you actually open the file. These stacked bars also contain "Values". These are the actual data that the stacked bar contains, the actuall preference. Some bars also contain "data" as their Value. This is a special Value for a .plist stacked data bar that means that data bar holds actuall data. For example, if you were a system programmer and wanted to store some data for the system, you could create a new PLIST file, create a  new bar, add the "<data>" tag to the bar's code, and add the data (the data is usually text). The file now stores data. Smetimes the data is just random letters and numbers and paths an just random text, but it usually means something.</p>
          </div>
          <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.dotx</b></button>
          <div class="content">
          <p>.dotx files are template Microsoft Word documents. They are basically Microsoft Word templates, like blank docement or Creative Resume or another template's sources. However, they are not marco-enabled.</p>
        </div>
          <button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>.kb</b></button>
        </div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>.kb files are "keybag" files. Some may be found in /private/var/db/keybags. Believe it or not, they are actually considered Documents on Mac OS X. These "keybag" files can sometimes contain user ID's, System ID's, or other kinds of ID's or contents. When you open them, Finder will say there's not application set to open that file, just press choose application, select TextEdit, and select Open. Don't check Always Open With, it will still always open with your application of choice (in this case, TextEdit) anyway. .kb files may be very long, seemingly random, and confusing. System code is just sometimes like that, and unless you have created your own .kb files, .kb files usually <i>are</i> System code.</p>
