      <h1>The pourpase of webpage warnings</h1>
    <p>On certain webpages, you may see warning pages and/or yellow boxes of text with a warning sign. On pages like these, <b><u>IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO CAREFULLY READ THE WARNINGS</u></b>. Here's why.</p>
      <h1>Webpage warnings are there to protect <i>you</i> (and maybe the basic integrity of your computer, tablet, or phone)</h1>
      <p>Warning pages or text boxes are, first and foremost, there to protect <i>you</i>. For example, if you visited a page about flooding websites with thouands of packets at once, we may give you a webpage warning that some websites may disband your account with that website or block you from accessing it ever again, and that it technically could be called a Denial Of Service Attack (DOS Attack). That warning would just be there to protect you from losing your favorite accounts and websites. Or, it could be there to protect the basic usability and integrity of your device, like a warning on a page that tells you how to wipe your filesystem.
        <h1>No, it's NOT a legal thing</h1>
        <p>You're probably thinking to yourself "Yeah right. This is probably just some law that makes you provide webpage warnings on dangerous pages." Well, I promise that this practice of delivering webpage warnings isn't even remotley related to anything legal. Our <a href="externalinformationNotices.html" target="_top">External Information Notices</a> are partly because of copyright laws and other legal things, but our webpage warnings are not legal or copyright related and never will be. We provide them soley to protect you and maybe your spot in your job (and maybe your device). That's the full truth told.</p>
        <h1>We can only do so much to make sure you read the warnings</h1>
        <p>Beyond creating popups when you don't check an aggrement checkbox, creating full-window warnings on seperate pages, using lots of text emphasis, images, and catch-your-eye colors, and giving you a page that encourages you to read warnings (hey, that's this page!), there's really not much more we can do to make you pay atention to webpage warnings. So pleae read them-they're for your own good!</p>
