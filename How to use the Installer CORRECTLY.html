<h1>How to use the Installer CORRECTLY on a mac-install without trouble or slowness</h1>
<p>Most mac users are farmilliar with the Installer, the application that installs and downloads new apps, software, programs, or kernel extensions. And most people <i>think</i> they know how to use it, but they don't aways actually know. To ensure you install software correctly and avoid trouble or slowness with the Installer, read this guide; I bet it will change how you use Installer quite a bit.</p>
<h4>How to use the Installer CORRECTLY on a mac-install without trouble or slowness: bulleted guide</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>Don't force-quit the installer-EVER!:</b> When using the Installer, there are multiple steps to install software such as privacy policy & license, destination select, intro, and more. If you at any time feel like you need to cancel the installation, at any point you can just close the window or normal-quit, press "Go back" to go back a step, and if you are on the "Software license agreement" part just press continue and press "Disagree" to cancel the installation and quit the installer. If it is installing with a progress bar, or prompting for administrator authentication, you can't do any of these. But if you want to cancel the installation when prompting for admin authentication, press cancel and normal-quit. If the Installer is installing with a progress bar, there is no canceling the installation except force quit-but you can always unintall the app later, and force-quitting the Installer at any time can result in you having part of an app installed and the other part missing, and force-quitting the Installer in the middle of an installtion could block other installations from working. You also may corrupt your Installer and downright not be able to use it at all, or have a broken program that opens at login. So don't force quit Installer.</li>
  <li><b>Never open an app or one of it's core files when it is still installing:</b> If you open a program or supporting file while you are still installing that program or the supporting files master program (the program that file supports), then you might open a half-configured, half-working, or half-downloaded program or file. In this case a few features might work but have errors and some just don't work at all. If it is a supporting file it may be incorrectly coded or missing big chunks or code, or words might be dissapearing or being re-written, or new words adding themselves. The program/file won't operate correctly and might not respond correctly to user input, and parts of it may be broken. This is because it is not fully installed and the whole, working program/file is still not fully on your computer and won't be until it is fully installed and the Installer finishes it's work. This can be bad because all kinds of things could happen inside that not-fully-installed program/file. It could close the window and open endless new ones, misconfigure redirects when you try to use the app, misenterpret user commands, look wierd, reload over and over and over again, reset itself multiple times, quit on you, or just downright not work at all how you expected it to.</li>
  <li><b>Don't use Installer for multiple pourpases at once unless you want bad results:</b> If you are trying to install multiple apps at once with Installer, good luck with that! The installation you started first, even by one millasecond, will continue, and the others (or just one other) will just get stuck at "Waiting for other installations to finish(or it might say "complete")" and stay like that until all your other installations finish, ultimatley slowing all of your imstallations down by a lot. In major cases there may even be a couple/one error(s) if installations are competing with each other in the same Installer app. So the point is that installing multiple programs at once inside the same Installer app at the same time could cause minor errors and will deffinetley slow all your installations down by a lot/medium.</li>
  <li><b>Never skip over a ReadMe file in Installer-or you will not know what to do later!:</b> This is the most common mistake in Installer: skipping ReadMe files. They are there to display important information about the app, the installation, and/or additional requirements. They are usually long like privacy policies, terms of use, or a license aggrement, but you can't afford to miss them or chances are you will install the program wrong or end up wrecking the program once it is already installed. So if you see a file in Installer called "ReadMe", read it.</li>
  <li><b>Don't open files with Installer unless they are .pkg files.:</b> .pkg files are "Package files" that are meant to open and run with and in the Installer to install their applications. If you open a .pkg file with Installer, <i>that's</i> fine. But it's not fine if you open a file that does <i>not</i> have .pkg as it's extension. For example, you can't open files with the .app, .doc, .docx, .file, .xcodeproj, .pptx, .sb, .lb, .dae, .jpg, .psd, .txt, .rtf, .exec, .dmg, no extension, or any other non-.pkg extension at the end with Installer. You might re-install a disk or program, get an error message, or corrupt the file. To be on the safe side with Installer, don't test it out.</li>
<br/>
<h1>How to install a program with Installer</h1>
<p><i>Now</i> it's time to see how to correctly install a program with the Installer. In my example, I will use Python IDLE, but you can install other programs with Installer, too.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open python-3.8.5-macosx10.9.pkg (or whatever program you are installing's .pkg file-I am using Python IDLE for my example) and click Continue after you read the introduction.</li>
  <img src="Installer screenshot 1.png" width="800px"/>
  <li>READ THE ReadMe FILE (skip this step if there is no Read Me file and ONLY if there is no Read Me file), AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. It may seem long and boring, but it provides you with important information about Python (or whatever you are installing, Python is just my example) and correctly installing Python (or whatever you are installing) and it's core files. Also, you can choose to Print or Save the License Aggrement from he bottom buttons. If there is no ReadMe file, you can skip to the next step. AND REMEMBER: You don't have to read any software license aggrements, privacy policies, terms of use, or terms of service unless you feel like it or want to, or that privacy policy or license agreement or terms really make you think you are installing malware.</li>
  <img src="Installer screenshot 2.png" width="800px"/>
  <li>You can choose to read or skip the License Agreement. As I said, it is long and boring, and unless you are a lawyer trying to sue the developers or company of whatever app you are installing (which is not likely), you deffinetley have the option to skip it. Be aware that you may put personal information at risk by skipping the license agreement or privacy policy, but this is all your choice. If you want to read it, just read the license aggrement and press Continue. You will be asked to confirm you have read and agree to the terms and license aggrement, just press Agree to continue. If you want to skip it, just press continue and press Agree. If you change your ming right at the last muninite, instead of pressing Agree, press Read License. And remember: if the privacy policy makes you second-guess the software you are installing, or if you just want to cancel the installation right when Installer asks you to agree or disagree to the License Aggrement or Terms, don't force-quit because thet is bad for the Installer; just click Disagree to cancel the installation and quit the Installer.</li>
  <img src="Installer screenshot 3.png" width="800px"/>
  <li>Once you agree to the licese/terms, sometimes the Installer will just skip the Destination Select, and sometimes you have to manually select the disk you want to install your program on-so if the Installer just skips to the "Standard Installation" or "Installation Type" page, skip this step. If you have to manually select where you wan to install your program, here's what to do: Select your startup disk (usually named "Macintosh HD", but if it is named something else just select the disk that looks like the Installer icon with a green Download arrow instead of a silver one). If any disk has a Warning triangle, don't pick that disk. If a disk has a green Download arrow on it, that means you can install the program on that disk and it is safe to pick. Once you selected a working disk running macOS with enough space, press Continue at the bottom.<b>IMPORTANT: IF YOUR STARTUP DISK HAS A WARNING TRIANGLE, EITHER YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THIS PROGRAM, YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DISK SPACE, YOUR STARTUP DISK IS DAMADGED, OR FOR SOME REASON YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT DISK RUNNING Mac OS. SEE THE DISK UTILITY GUIDE TO REPAIR A DAMADGED DISK OR FREE UP MORE SPACE. SEE THE Recovery OS Mode GUIDE TO SEE HOW TO FULLY WIPE YOUR COMPUTER AND REINSTALL Mac OS TO GET RID OF INCOMPATABILITY ISSUES AND MAKE SURE YOUR STARTUP DISK IS RUNNING Mac OS. </b><a href="Disk Utility macOS app.html">Disk Utility guide (damadged startup disk or low disk space)</a>
    <br/>
<a href="What is Recovery OS mode.html">Recovery OS Mode guide (incompatible operating system or your startup disk is not running macOS)</a></li>
<img src="Installer screenshot 4.png" width="800px"/>
<li>Once you press Continue after selecting a working disk running macOS with enough space (if uou had to do that manually), you will be brought to the "Installation type" or "Standard Installation" page. You may notice that there are different buttons on the bottom because this is the page where you configure the instllation and how and what it installs, and then finally install the software. Unless you are an app developer and kno what you are doing, I reccomend a Standard Installation. To preform at Standard Installation, just press Install at the bottom of the page and let the Installer do it's thing. If you are an app developer and know what you are doing, you can press Customize to customize what supporting files and code get installed, how they are installed, how they are formatted, and what additional things you want to install. Just press the Customize button at the bottom of the page. Click Standard Install to go back and just standard install the software. Press Install when you are ready, no matter what type of installation you are doing.</li>

<img src="Installer screenshot 6.png" width="800px"/>
<li>You will be prompted for an administrator name and password or a administrator's Touch ID. Just fill out the name and password fields with an administrator name and password or touch and administrator's Touch ID. Remember, a standard user's username and password won't work, but this guide will asume you are an administrator.</li>
<img src="Installer screenshot 7.png" width="800px"/>
<li>Just wait for the installation to complete. You should see a blue progress bar, possibly an estimated time remaining (don't trust those estimated times remaingin, though; sometimes they change from 42 muninites to one muninite in two seconds), and a header message showing the stage the installation is at.</li>

<li>Once the installation is finished, you will have to manullly nvigate to the app you just installed. You will be prompted to delete the package file, just delete it (this won't delete the app you installed, just the package.). Installed programs usually go to the Application folder, found at /Applications (it is a <a href="Top-level folders.html">top-level folder</a> and so is it's own path)
