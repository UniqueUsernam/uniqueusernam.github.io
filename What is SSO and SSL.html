<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>When you sign into any non-malware account, such as Google, the website you are logging into uses 4 things to log you in with your credentials: SSL (Secure Sockets Layer; it encrypts your password, username ,email, etc. when you put them into the website), Cookies (if you already have an account and are logging back in, the website uses cookies to remember to except your login credentials and what they are), SSO (this is optional and not always avaliable. It stands for Single Sign On and auto-loggs you in across multiple websites at once), and JavaScript (which is how the login fields can reflect what you type, how the buttons (such as "Log In" or "Continue") work, and how it knows how to process login credentials). In this guide, I will tell you about how SSO (Single Sign On) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) operate and work.</p>
<br/>
<h1>SSO (Single Sign on)</h1>
<p>SSO (Single Sign On) auto loggs you in across multiple websites at once without you doing anything. It works by taking your previously entered login credentials (you could have entered them like a year ago or less or even more) and automatically tells each website using the Single Sign On that these are the login credentials, sign into these websites for this user with these login credentials automatically. Of couse it does this through web servers and code. The Single Sign On process is sometimes immediate and sometimes loads for a few seconds. While the SSO login is loading, you may see wierd URL's (Uniform Resource Locators) in the adress bar, some of which have main domains you have never visited yourself. Just let the Single Sign On do it's thing; interrupting it would increase the chance of problems, and leaving it alone would generally not cause any problems. These Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) are most likely just websites the Single Sign On (SSO) uses to log you in across multiple connected websites a once. And remember: the websites the Single Sign On (SSO) visit are different than the ones <i>you</i> visit.</p>

<h1>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)</h1>
<p>You may have heard of "SSL Secured Shopping", or "SSL Secured Browsing", or "SSL Secured Login", but what is this popular security method that websites use to encrypt transmitted data? SSL stands for "Secure Sockets Layer" and what it does is when you enter data on a webpage (such as payment info to buy things, login credentials to acess an account, or a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in a browser to view a website), the website has to send it to the server to process the request-and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encrypts the data you send to the web server so hackers can't see what that data is while it is being sent from one computer to the next on a signal and/or through the Internet. So if a hacker managed to get into the signal being used to transmit the data between severs an manages to see and intercept your request, it would be encrypted with Secure sockets Layer and all they would see would be the encrypted version of the information and they couldn't actually see any of the transmitted information. That's why it is common for logins and shopping; in both of those you would be transmitting personal data, and the website protects it with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption while in transmit both ways.</p>

   <h1>How to use these</h1>
   <p>Generally, you don't need to do anything; just let the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Single Sign On (SSO) do it's thing and don't go poking around in certificate settings so you don't <i>disable</i> it-but these are usually automatically on when avaliable. If you see any security warnings related to login or shopping, don't login or shop on that website with that internet connection at that time in that browser at that webpage. You can try again later, follow the onscreen instructions, try again, switch browser or internet connection, and maybe tweak your security settings, or you could just wait and refresh frequently (command+r or ðŸ”„ button near the adress bar).</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>So that's how Single Sign On (SSO) and Secure Sockets Layer work; one protects your privacy and one makes things more convinient <i>and</i> secure. And as I said above, these features generally require little or no setup and do a lot.</p>
