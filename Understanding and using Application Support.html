<h1>What is Application Support?</h1>
<p>The Application Support folder is frequently used and visited, and you should know about it. First of all, you can find it by opening Macintosh HD and clicking "Library". Application Support should be the second folder shown in Library, after Apple. <b><i>WHATEVER YOU DO, NEVER TOUCH THE Apple FOLDER! IT HAS CORE SYSTEM FILES, IMPORTANT <a href="All about terminal.html">exec</a> FILES, AND OTHER STUFF YOU SHOULDN"T EVER TOUCH.</i></b> Application Support's path is /Library/Application Support. Application Support's pourpase is to support your applications-it holds alll of your preferences for individual applications, some downloads, cookies, core files for your applications, updates, features, code for your applications, uploads, a few <a href="all about Terminal.html">exec files</a> that your applications and programs use, and any other files that support your applications. Any application-even a piece of malware-can do whatever they want and put any amount of any files anywhere in Application Support; Application Support is basically the folder for anything Application or program related. /Library/Application Support can even hold a few system-related files, maybe for some system applications (most system applications end with the letter d so they are easy to spot-so if you ever see an Agent, Daemon, Process, Program, Application, or even folder ending with d it is probably system-related) or even some Apple tools and preferences for the computer (generally any Apple tools or preferences are stored in Application Support's "Apple" folder aswell in /Library/Apple, the first folder showing up and THE ONE YOU SHOULD NOT MESS WITH). So basically Application Support holds all the files for your applications and a few for the system. Each individual program has it's own Application support folder in /Library/Application Support, and each folder can contain as many subfolders as it's Application wants.</p>

<h1>The very mysterious "ApplePushService" folder</h1>
<p>So you know what Application Support is: a folder that helps run your applications and stores their core files. But you may notice that there is one little folder called "ApplePushService". Why worry about this one folder? It is the only folder in Application Support that is locked; you aren't able to open ApplePushService, are you? It has a red "Do Not Enter" minus sign. When you double-click, the finder says "<b>The folder ‚ÄúApplePushService‚Äù can‚Äôt be opened because you don‚Äôt have permission to see its contents.</b>" and when you press command-o to open, your computer just dings or does nothing at all. When you choose File menu>Open, the "Open" option aswell as the "Open with" option is greyed out. It dosen't even allow you to print ApplePushService! This means you have a strange folder you can't see inside of in your Application Support directory-and remember when I said even malware can put things in Application Support if it is installed on your computer? Well the good news is that ApplePushService is most deffinelley <i>not</i> malware-it is actually the <i>oposite</i> of malware: ApplePushService is actually a layer of security for your Mac. And messing with it will bring more problems then not messing with it. So just leave <i>that</i> be. ApplePushService is also related to iCloud syncing, so if you use iCloud there's another reason to leave ApplePushService be. I will tell you how to get into locked folders anyway, scince it is a useful skill-but don't mess with ApplePushService. Here are three ways you can get into locked folders:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Through Terminal: open Terminal and type "open; sudo rm [PUT THE PATH OF THE FILE YoU WANT TO FORCE-OPEN HERE]" and enter your password. Terminal won't show what you are typing, just press enter when you typed it. The locked file/folder should open, but if it dosen't it is protected by the <a href="What is SIP.html">SIP (System Integrity Protection)</a>. Try another step if this is the case.</li>
  <li>Through the permissions pane: this is probably the easiest but not always effective option, and you have to know your way around Finder for this. Click the locked file/folder so it is highlighted, and press command-i to open up the "Get Info" window. At the very bottom of this window you will see the words "Sharing & File Permissions‚ñ∑" with a "‚ñ∑" sign at the end. Click on the "‚ñ∑" symbol to expand the Sharing & File Permissions window, and click the tiny lock icon (üîí), and enter your Administrator name and password. In the dropdown next to "üë®üèø‚ÄçYou", change the permissions from "No acess" or "Read only" to "Read & Write". Then deauthenticate (click the lock icon againüîì) and close the window. (If you saw no "üë®üèø‚ÄçYou" option in that window, change permissions for "Everyone" insted but change permissions back when you are done.) Now open the folder and you should have acess. If you see "The operation can't be completed because you don't have the necessary permission" when you are changing the permissions, make sure that before changing permissions you clicked the lock icon and entered an administrator's name and password. Also, if the lock icon greyed out/was already greyed out after/before you entered an administrator name and password, it means you need to be even higher than an administrator to change permissions on that file. It could be <a href="What is SIP.html">protected by the SIP (System Integrity Protection)</a>. Your best bet there is to follow these same steps in root user, or System Administrator Mode. <a href="How to enable root user in macOS.html">How to enable and use root user on a mac</a>. Or, the file could be locked with the "Locked" checkbox (not the same kind of locked as No Access permissions or permissions errors). In this case look in the "General" pane and uncheck the "Locked" box. If it is greyed out, checked or unchecked, this file is probably <a href="What is SIP.html">SIP-protected</a>.</li>
  <li>Through file-duplicating and authentication: This is the way that I figured out by myself. No books, websites, or teachers involved. Just drag the file onto your desktop, enter an administrator name and password or administrator Touch ID, abd the folder should be copied. Now delete the original (keeping the copy) and enter an administrator name and password/Touch ID when macOS prompts for authentication. Empty the Trash-<b><i>DO NOT use delete immediatley!</b></i> Now drag the copy you made into the folder the original was in. If it is protected, click Authenticate and enter an administrator name and password/Touch ID. Now double-click the folder you just moved and it should be open. If you run into errors at any time in this process, <a href="How to enable root user in macOS">run in root user</a> to reduce the chance of permissions errors. If the folder is open but empty, check the folder's Get Info panel from what appears to be inside the folder and see if your permission is Read & Write. If not, change the pemissions from the permissions pane with our "With the permissions pane" bulleted item or through Terminal.
