  <p>Most normal Mac users never come across files and folders in the /sbin directory, or <b>S</b>ystem <b>Bin</b>aries directory, and if they have maybe they did not pay much attention to the "authserver" folder sitting at the top with a red minus sign that means you have no right to acess it. But those who have tried to open "authserver" will find they can't. When you double-click Finder says "<b>The folder “authserver” can’t be opened because you don’t have permission to see its contents.</b>" The computer just dings or dows nothing when I use command-o. When I choose File>Open, the Open, Open With, Print, New Folder, and New Folder with Selection options are greyed out. I've tried and failed to use the following to open authserver:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Double-clicking just gets me "<b>The folder “authserver” can’t be opened because you don’t have permission to see its contents.</b>".</li>
    <li>When I choose File>Open, the Open, Print, New Folder, Open With, and New Folder with Selection options are greyed out.</li>
    <li>When I press command-o the computer either dings or does nothing.</li>
    <li>I open Terminal, type sudo open /usr/sbin/authserver, enter my administrator password, and authserver opens but there is a red minus sign on the folder icon on the very top of the window and authserver appears to be empty (even though I know authserver is NOT empty because it is locked and who would lock an empty folder!)! Then I do a test on the permissions by typing open /usr/sbin/authserver without the sudo and it opens but looks empty. I check the permissions from what <i>appears</i> to be <i>inside</i> authserver and I still have no access! </li>
    <li>I type sudo cd /usr/sbin/authserver, enter my administrator password, and then insted of completing the command and cd-ing authserver, Terminal just responds by saying "[MY USERNAME]@MacBook-Air ~ %" on a new line. Does not show any sign of executing my command, even with sudo at the beginning.</li>
    <li>I open Finder, press shift-command-g and type the exact path of authserver (/usr/sbin/authserver) beginning with a / in Go To Folder, and the Finder displays the only error message that can be displayed in Go To Folder: "The folder can't be found." I am sure that the folder actually was found, but permissions were denied like in every other thing I tried and so the Finder couldn't open authserver-but the only error message that can be displayed in Go To Folder is "The folder can't  e found." so it showed that even though it is actually a permissions error that stoped me from getting into authserver.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>(The scribbled on parts are my usernae.) None of them worked.</p>

  <h1>Fix</h1>
  <p>A simple, two-letter Terminal command with sudo can easily get anyone into authserver. Just open Terminal (located in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app), and type this command without the quotes: "sudo ls /usr/sbin/authserver", and press the return (or enter) key. Type your password at the password prompt (if you are not an administrator user, this won't work) and press return/enter (the Terminal won't show what you type when enter your password, just type anyway). Now Terminal will show a text list of all the folders inside authserver.
