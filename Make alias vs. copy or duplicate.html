<p>In the Finder on your Mac, you may notice that when you control-click a file or folder, there is the option to Copy, Duplicate, or Make an Alias of that item (file/folder). Make Alias, Duplicate, and Copy don't do the same thing. First of all, Duplicate will create a copy of the file or folder instantly, in the same location as the original file. The new file will be named with the word "copy" at the very end, even after the extension sometimes. If you continue to create duplicates, they'll be called "copy 2", "copy 3", and so on. And copy will effectively place the file or folder in a kind of clipboard/holding pattern, and you can then browse in the Finder to another location and use Paste to save a copy to the new location. It will be given the same name as the original (no "copy" suffix) unless a file of that name already exists, in which case you'll be prompted to overwrite it. If you do a copy/paste operation in the same folder as the original, it'll have the same effect as Duplicate. Basically, Copy can copy to a different location (like when you copy/paste text in a web browser or document), wheras Duplicate directly duplicates the file to the same location instantly and adding a "copy" suffix. But Make Alias is a different story.
