        <p>This webpage contains instructions on how to remove Apple iPad supervision. However, if you are using a device that either came supervised or is managed by the company you work for/your collage, Graduation School, High School, Elementary school, or other education, <span style="color:red"><i><u><em><b>YOU MAY NOT VIEW THIS PAGE</b></em></u></i></span> because one: you may have terms or conditions of use of your device that I, the creator of this website and page, obviously wouldn't know about and two: just as importantly, devices that came supervised are probably supervised for a <i>reason</i>, and removing supevision might get you in trouble with your company/school or allow you to misuse your device for pourpases your company/education might not intend, and three: last but not least, if you're device originally came supervised or was made supervised by your company with you aware of it, it's technically <i>not</i> your device, and removing supervision is like stealing from your company in a certain way.</p>
