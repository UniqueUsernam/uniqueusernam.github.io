<h1>What are top-level mac folders?</h1>
  <a href="index.html" class="myButton">Go back home</a>
<p>Your top-level mac folders are the folders that are right there on your disk, folders that are not inside any other folder. Each folder is very important and has a very different and important job. Each Mac has four top-level folders: Applications, Library, System, and Users. They are the first things you see when you open your startup disk up. All top-level folders have indents on them, each indent a picture of whatever it's name is. All top-level folders are undeletable to protect each folder's data, and the System top-level folder is not able to be modified by anyone but the system itself. The Library foldef is set to read only and can only be modified by computer administrators and the system. The Applications folder is set to read only to everyone except computer administrators and the system. The Users folder can only be modified by the system and computer administrators that have authenticated at the prompt before modifying Users. Top-level folders all have their own path (for example Applications's path is just /Applications, Library's is /Library, System's is /System, Users's is /Users, because they are not subfolders to anything-so each top-level folder's path is just it's name with a slash at the beginning). Let's break these folders down and then give you an overview of what they do.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
  <li><b>Applications:</b> The Applications folder holds all/most of your programs, undeleted package files, supporting files for programs(you can view most programs's supporting and related files by control-clicking on the program and selecting "Show package contents" and double-clicking the "Contents" folder that just appeared), and apps. It's indent is a big letter <b>A</b> made out of popcicle sticks. It's permissions are read only to evreyone except computer administrators and the system. It is generally very large because programs are usually large and Applications holds all/most of the programs on the computer-even programs inslled by other users are visible inside Applications. It may have a few subfolders, for example if you insall frameworks in Applications or install multiple programs or programs that deliver .command (executable files that open with <a href="All about Terminal.html">Terminal</a>) files needed for the operation of the program. Actually, all your programs can be opened in three different ways: double clicking or pressing command-o will open the application as a program (see <a href="Understanding macOS's .app extension.html">Understanding macOS's .app extension</a> for more information on how programs open as programs), control-clicking and selecting "Show package contents" shows all related and supporting files and opens the app <i>as a folder</i>, and control-clicking, selecting "Show package contents", double-clicking the "Contents" folder that just appeared, opening the "MacOS" folder, and opening the exec file will open the program in binary format with Terminal. By default all programs installed by the Installer or .dmg files are routed into Applications, and most programs are installed that way nowadays. Also, all programs installed with the App Store are placed in Applications by default too-so you can basically think of Applications as the folder for programs and maybe a few .command files or frameworks. Pretty important, right?!

  <li><b>Library:</b> The Library folder holds most/a lot of system data for specific pourpases (for exampe, there is a Security folder, a Filesystems folder, an Extensions folder, a Scripts folder, a Catacomb folder, and much, much, <i>much,</i> more!). It's indent is a picture of a library with pillars at th front. Unlike Applications or Users, it has TONS of subfolders-it's full of different subfolders to catagorize the lots of data it holds for different actions. In fact, my Library folder holds 125,037 subfolders! And each subfolder in Library has many of it's own subfolders to hold it's data. There are some that hold up to 471 subfolders! Most folders can also contain documents and single files. Most of these have the ".plist" extension which stands for "<b>P</b>roperty <b>List</b>" and opens with Xcode (a developer app pre-installed and developed by Apple). A .plist file is a system settings and preference file. Usually when you open them they look like a stack of bars with a ▸ next to them to show more bars, and that holds more bars, so on. Each stacked bar has a name (or a "Key" as Xcode calls it), the type of data the bar is, a plus button and minus button (only visible when you hover over the specific stacked bar), an expand (▸) button to view the bars that bar contains, and in grey text between parenthases, how many other bars (or Items) that stacked bar contains. These stacked bars also contain "Values". These are the actual data that the stacked bar contains, the actuall preference. Some bars also contain "data" as their Value. This is a special Value for a .plist stacked data bar that means that data bar holds actuall data. For example, if you were a system programmer and wanted to store some data for the system, you could create a new PLIST file, create a  new bar, add the "<data>" tag to the bar's code, and add the data (the data is usually text). The file now stores data. Smetimes the data is just random letters and numbers and paths an just random text, but it usually means something.
When you quick-look the .plist file, though, it shows a bunch of code (very usually XML code) instead of stacked data bars, which only become visible when you actually open the file. Now back to Library. Library starts out as just a bunch of folders, but each folder serves a specfic pourpase and holds data for that pourpase. Usually you can get the porpase from the name, if you know how. Each name is the both what data that folder holds and the specific pourpase and type of that data (for example, LaunchAgents and LaunchDaemons are processes that automatically run in the background, and LaunchDaemons versus LaunchAgents specifies the type of background services in itself-same as Fonts and Fonts Disabled hold fonts for your computer, and Fonts versus Fonts Disabled specifies if the fonts that folder contains are active, usable, and enabled, or disabled and not active). So if you see a folder named "PreferencePanes" and another called "Preferences", those names tell you that they hold preferences and settings, and the pourpase and type of preferences that specific folder holds (fun fact: the "Preferences" folder holds a few subfolders for different categories or preferences, and holds A TON of .plist files and .plist~orig (original preference files that open with Adobe Acrobat-scince these files ae from the original state of the computer and are truncated in various Library folders, these preference files do not change when preferences and data are changed, and may not be acurate or correct) for prefernences and settings, and PreferencePanes holdes third-party System Preferences panes). Some Library subfolders contain other types of files <i>and</i> PLIST files that determine preferences for the other data. Libary containd specific categories of data for your computer and is home to data created by programs <i>and</i> the system. That's important too!

<li><b>System:</b> System stores important system data for the system to operate. It's indent is a big X. It's permissions are the strictest of all top-level folders and actually some of the strictest of all folders: Tottally unmodifyable to anyone excpt the system and is <a href="What is SIP.html">SIP (System Integrity Protection)</a>-protected meaning nobody can change the permissions, modify, or rename that folder-even computer administrators and <a href="How to enable root user in macOS.html">root user</a>. It is read only for everyone, including Staff and Wheel, except for the System (which has Read & write) when you look at it's permission in Get Info. You can, however, read and open the folder. System contains you whole Mac OS operating system! When you first open System, it dosen't look like much; just five subfolders, one with the same indent and name as Library (there is Applications, DriverKit, iOSSupport, Library(the one with an indent), and Volumes). First we will talk about Applications. System actually contains it's own unindented copy of Applications (which we talked about earlier-Applications is also a top-level folder)! When you open System's copy of Applications, though, it looks a bit different. First of all, it dosen't contain any subfolders, frameworks, or .command files. The only subfolder in it is Utilities, which is an unindented and unnoficial copy. And even that dosen't have the usuall six Adobe Utilities folders; just the straight Utilities programs. It also dosen't contain ANY package or .dmg files, or .zip files
that were placed there by programs. Basically, the unofficial copy of Applications in System contains programs only (and the Utilities folder), and not any other file types. And programs or files inside subfolders in Applications (programs stored in their own folders in the real official Applications) won't appear either, unless they were in Utilities and were not Adobe-related or in subfolders in Utilities. Also, things you dragged into Applications manually won't appear here. So basically, it only contains the raw programs. Why? Because System dosen't store all that extra app-related data; just the raw ptograms and that's it. Personal applications don't show up either. This may be useful if you just want a clean list of your public programs and nothing more. Now we can talk about Volumes: System actually also contains an unnoficial copy of YOUR WHOLE COMPUTER. Really, System has an unnoficial copy of your entire startup disk! If you open Volumes (the folder closest to the right) and double-click your Startup Disk, you will see all of your top-level folders-just as if you were opening your <i>real</i> Startup Disk! None of them will have indents, but they will all have the same data and have he same content as the real ones except for the unindented, unofficial version of System (because you ae actually <i>in</i> System). Library and Users are exactly the same, and Applications is the same too (it even has subfolders, frameworks, .command files, .dmg files, package files, and manually-added files, just like normal). But when you double-click the unindented, unnoffficial version of System, all you will see is a folder called "Library". It won't even be indented. This is because that Library folder is actually a tottally seperate and new Library folder, not the top-level Library folder with lots of subfolders I talked about earlier, not the Library folder in the real, indented, official System folder, but a tottally new and different one. When you open it, there are seven folders: Assets, AssetsV2, Caches, CoreServices, PreinstalledAssets, PreinstalledAssetsV2, and Speech. I will only talk about AssetsV2 right now, scince this is getting long. AssetsV2 is a special kind of Assets that are mostly com.apple (system identifiers) folders. Usually, when you open one, there is one or more XML or PLIST file, and one or more folder. Sometimes, even a one tiny subfolder in an AssetsV2 folder can contain up to 949 items, or ad low as 12! AssetsV2 is a folder that can be found in the normal /System/Library folder, but sometimes it is empty and this AssetsV2 is <i>full</i>. Don't delete the empty version. AssetsV2 folders can contain vrious different file types. Now back to System. The Library folder in system is basically a library of data needed for the system to operate, and DriverKit contains various PLISt, XML, and .bundle documents, and some folders to catagorize the data. It also has some frameworks. iOSSupport has basically a few files for here and there system stuff. This System folder contains a lot!

<li><b>Users:</b> The Users folder has the data for every single user on your computer. It's indent is a picture of a profile. It's permissions are Read & Write for the System, read Only for computer administrators, and Read Only for everybody. You can't change the permissions on Users. When you create a new user on your computer, either from Users And Groups Preferences or as the first user on your Mac, or maybe from a data migration, that user and it's <a href="Home folder.html">Home folder</a> go into the Users folder. A user's <a href="Home folder.html">Home folder</a> contains all that user's data and some Sstem-related data for that user. It has that user's personal Applications too. In the Users folder, the currently logged in user's <a href="Home folder.html">Home folder</a> look like a house and all other user's <a href="Home folder.html">Home folders</a> look like regular folders. If you open another user's <a href="Home folder.html">Home folder</a>, all their data will be locked to protect that user's privacy, but if you open your own <a href="Home folder.html">Home folder</a>, all the data will be unlocked and acessible. Each user's <a href="Home folder.html">Home folder</a> has one folder called "Public". All users can open the Public folder, even if it is from another user. Inside, you will see a "Drop Box" folder. If you are looking at your own Drop Box folder, it will be unlocked and acessible. If it is another user's Drop Box folder, you can put items in it, but you can't open the folder or see them. So if one user wants to share some data with another user, they can open their <a href="Home folder.html">Home folder</a>, open their "Public" folder, and drag the data you want to share into their Drop Box folder. The next time they view their Drop Box folder, the data will be sitting there for them. There is also a Shared folder in the Users folder. This folder contains items that are avaliable for all users to use.

<h1>Overview of top-level folders and basic information on them</h1>
<p style="font-size="15px" class="External-information-notice""><i>This information is copied from the Apple Support website. It was not created on this site. However, some edits were made after the information was copied and pasted.</i></p>
<h3>Applications</h3>
This folder contains apps, including Mail, Calendar, Safari, and many others. Apps in this folder also appear in Launchpad. If you try to drag an app out of the Applications folder, it isn’t moved; instead, an alias is created. If you want to uninstall an app, see Install and uninstall apps.

<h3>Library</h3>
This folder contains fonts, internet plug-ins, and other items used by apps that are available to all users of your Mac. This folder also contains preferences and system data catagorized in different folders. Don’t use this folder to store files and folders you create. Instead, use the <a href="Home folder.html">Home folder</a>, the Desktop folder, the Documents folder, or iCloud Drive.

System
This folder contains the macOS operating system. You can’t change the name or location of the System folder or the items within it.

Users
This folder contains the home folders of all the people set up as users on your Mac. When you’re logged in, the icon for your home folder looks like a house, and the other home folders look like regular folders. If you log out and someone else logs in, that person’s home folder then looks like a house. The Users folder also contains the Shared folder. Items in the Shared folder are available to anyone who uses your Mac.

Home
Your home folder is named with your user name and has folders for your desktop files, downloads, pictures, documents, movies, music, and any public files. You can create folders in your home folder.

Additionally, you can create folders in your iCloud Drive folder, the Documents folder, or on the desktop (on your Mac or in iCloud Desktop and Documents) to organize your files. There are certain locations where you may not be able to create additional folders.
