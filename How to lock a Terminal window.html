<p>When you have a Terminal session, typing this command and that, sudo this and dscl. and help <\verb>, or cat that, sometimes you might just want to be DONE. Normally you just close the window or quit terminal, and that's fine. But if you just want to end a Terminal session and lock the Terminal to any other users and yourself, if you want no way to restore that session, then just type these commands in order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Type <span class="Terminal-command">logout</span> in the Terminal and press [return] or [enter], whichever one you have. This won't actually log you or any other users out or quit any processes at all; it will just lock the Terminal widow.</li>
  <li>If you see the [Process completed] message, you can't type in that Terminal window again. If you try typing a command, it won't appear and it won't run. Make a new Terminal window to type commands and run code-that window is locked! It's that simple!</li>
