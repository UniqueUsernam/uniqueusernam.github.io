      <h1>What is root user?</h1>
      <h1>(I DID NOT DO THIS!!!!)</h1>
      <p>macOS root user, also knon as System Administrator Mode, gives you full power over the system and you have the right to acess any protected or locked files not <a href="What is SIP.html">protected by the SIP (System Integrity Protection)</a> while in root user, or System Adminisatrator Mode. In other words, it is the highest level of power you can have on a mac-even higher then admin. But root user is certiantly not for everyone.
